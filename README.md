# Decimal to Binary FloatingPoint

## Description
Convert the decimal number to the BCIT binary floating point expression. The BCIT expression is based on the IEEE standard and is minified to a simpler version. 

* Sign: 1-bit

* Exponent: 4-bit (Bias 7)

* Mantissa: 5-bit

For example: The number 42 will be represented in the BCIT floating point as : 

0 | 1100 | 01010
